# Chat App with AWS Lambda
This is a basic structure / boilerplate for using AWS Lambda with PostgreSQL. It is still a work in progress, but much of the backend work is complete.

## Backend
This is the only piece of work that has been completed for this so far, you can find it here: https://github.com/adcostanza/chat-app/tree/master/backend

## Frontend
This has not been started but will be shortly and will consume the serverless lambda API provided by the backend.
